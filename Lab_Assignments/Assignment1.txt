/* The algorithm allows the user to create an estimate of the cost to build a table.  
The algorithm will be made up of a menu driven algorithm that will continue until the user specifically 
states that they do not want any additional estimates. */

LET tableCounter is a positive natural number that holds the count of estimated tables.
LET pie is a floating number that holds a value of mathematical pie as 3.14159.
LET totalCost is a floating number that holds the sum of all estimates costs.
LET choice is a natural number that represents the choice of the user.
LET length is a floating number that holds the length measurenment of a table.
LET width is a floating number that holds the width measurenment of a table.
LET diameter is a floating number that holds the diameter measurenment of a circular table.
LET tableCost is a floating number that holds the cost of a single table.
LET area is a floating number that holds the area a table.
